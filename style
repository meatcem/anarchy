# overabstracting hinder societal progress

1- homo-sapiens ability to reasons is relative to experience, by scaling new experience on old memories, we either emperically classify, or define new object relative to old experience, planning different future can only be achieved through experimenting, or decoding the past to extend our experience.

2- our ability of abstract thinking of hunter-gathers made us propense to take top-down thinking approach, from overarching general principle to the problem in hand, down to the details, such method can be utilized for understanding linear phenomenon such as physics, but extreme abstraction to cover turning points in non-linear phenomenons as evolution, or society is arbitrary, subjective thinking, and deviant from truth such as metaphysics methodology, such methodology shouldn't be utilized by social engineer, instead, bottom-up approach should be utilized, starting with social problem, can enable developer to knock off problems from it's root, without compromise.

3- positivism philosophy assumes natural laws are fixed beyond our experience, and what we perceive, and interpret as laws, can be generalized on undiscovered distant spacetime, it give no regard to turning points, or evolving phenomenons, such philosophy fall into top-down thinking approach, such linear methodology is occupied dealing with symptoms of historical evolution, but fails to dissect it's components, and trace consequences to their roots.

4- historical materialism looks at the tip of the iceberg of social economics, and abstract to the whole society, it perceives humanes as automaton fitting into inevitable economical machine, without questioning the machine, and class struggle eruption in the machine leading to turning point, it's philosophy is isolated from the rest of the environment, ecological, psychological, anthropological aspect of society, regressing tuning points into economical changes, seeing the end point of change as the root of change attributing to class struggle without understanding class struggle, it another mask of positivism philosophy of studying linear phenomenon, disguising regressed societal evolution by economical change!

5- both positivism, and historical materialism are build on idealism, such philosophy abstract the perceived phenomenon to the distant, and unrealizable reality, if such methodology to be used in studying evolving society, mistakes are inevitable.

6- in engineering the future, each aspect of society must be studied as teleological end of historical evolutionary causes, and by tracing the causal factors, we can reach to the true role, only then a replacement of old system can be done with minimal negative consequences without committing Chesterton's fence fallacy.

# art of social engineering

7- in social engineering a society, social model need to be flexible, in ease of construction, dynamic, ability to adapt to new circumistances by changing directed networks of old model for satisfying old role considering new circumistances, or outcomes, bottom-up, starting with the problems, tracing it's causal factors, and constructing new model based off societal needs discovered.

8- characteristics of social model construct, made of factual blocks to be assumptions, propositions, or conclusions, without violating the societal needs of tracing problems to their origin, factual blocks are as succinct as possible for flexibility as in the Greek philosophy, factual blocks are objective, and testable, or provable, conclusions are logically driven from factual blocks, that could be graphed mathematically.

9- social construct is be based on a mosaic factual blocks connected by logically driven conclusions analogous to solving a puzzle, having those characteristic, will protect against idealizing vain positivist model of society, by the fact that factual blocks are representation of objective, testable, or provable conclusion of society driven by logical construct, decoding messages of history of society instead of suppressing them, with succinct factual blocks, the construct will have high adaptivity to criticisms, false interpretations, and new knowledge. devoid of dogma, or arbitrary Utopian constructs.
