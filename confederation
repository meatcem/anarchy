# egalitarian confederacy

1- confederacy is integration of forces, and resources for maximizing development, survival, and chances of self-preservation.

2- for maintaining egalitarianism direction of power should be maintained to point upward from komingeh to confederacy.

3- from the requirement of confederacy to maximize development, which maintained by communes, confederacy may be achieved on the komingehs communal level without any central komingeh authority, integration between different sets of komingehs communes can join forces to work on common goals.

4- autonomy of commune requires autonomous administration, with no external influence, therefore the political power of confederacy of different communes with common objectives is only limited to confederated communes communalists.

5- for maintaining egalitarianism on confederacy level, confederated communalists are expected to share equal political weight.

# benevolence of confederation

6- confederacy can facilitate knowledge-sharing publicly, or confidentially according to sensitivity of data for advancing research, and administration philosophy, self-propagation of prospering komingehs, leaving definition of prosperity to the confederated members, as well as swap of resources in stretched, or dispersed stretches of land in cases of independence, and population fluctuation.

7- for komingeh of relatively small size, setting walls, and bordered can turn egalitarianism into cage, confederation of commutation communes will facilitate transportation, and commutation policies, for travel, tourism, and also extending self-propagation effect.

8- confederation as form of integrating efforts, and joining forces can be achieved with external states as well, if they share common target!

9- shared economy on the confederation level along with conflicting binding ethos should be left to morality of the communalists, and not to be enforced by confederal policy, reallocating resources, or providing support for another komingeh will required public political power, and shouldn't not be left to representative of specific commune as it will affect every communalist share of resources.

10- it follows from egalitarian characteristic of confederacy that any sort of power shouldn't be inflicted upon any komingeh, or commune, therefore conscious evolution by penalization malicious komingeh is required, instead of central authority with social contract of conflicting binding ethos, resolving conflicts of neighboring communes, especially environmental problems need to be handled morally, despite the differences.

11- diplomacy commune is for direct representation of the whole society in resolving conflicts, negotiations, and trade, but direct political power still can be maintained in driving decisions.
 
# independence, and integration.

12- in moral-political society of relatively limited size, ramification of new ideas, and philosophies of living of binding ethos can occur rapidly, 100 advocate can asymptotically present 15k in few days, or minutes using technology, and with egalitarian characteristic of society, Zara can descend from the mountain without hindrance, leading to unresolved conflicted binding ethos in the worst case scenario, such extreme situation of equal parity of political weight can hinder progress of society, endangering it's egalitarianism by biased political weight, therefore independence, or demarcation for resources is natural to take place for progress of both philosophies, and minimal conflicts of equality.

13- such phenomena of independence is unknown to egalitarian clan, or tribe, for it's small size, and simplicity of relations, tasks, and challenges, the bigger the society, and more complex the relations, and binding ethos, and more conflict can emerge, small egalitarian society used methods of ostracism, and even execution in extreme cases to fight any form of deviance, for a small number of deviants they have low chances of survival, self-preservation of their siblings. in modern egalitarian society, sufficient enough number of communalists of few thousands may achieve autonomy as independent komingeh.

14- each komingeh is an experiment of uniquely different biding ethos, it's endurance, effectiveness in achieving propensity of living is tested, for komingeh to survive, philosophies need to be developed, achieving common ground truth of binding ethos, giving the possibility for integration between communes, and komingeh for benevolence, and strength of unity of common shared ethos.

15- continuity of komingeh manifest it's evolving philosophies, and convergence to universal truth, philosophies will converge after decoding the universal history, tolerance of philosophies will follow to increases, with minimal conflicts, achieving universal cosmopolitan purpose of prosperity, and preservation, contracted with the state law hindering any moral development, but rather contributing to it's entropy.
