# political evolution, a prospective into despotism, and inequality

1- life is a result of procreation pivoted around the fertile female, biological interaction is directed by the state of nature, with abundance of resources, complexity of interactions changes, for our closest, and ancestral primate foragers, they live in highly interactive systems in demarcated territory mandated by competing troops, the latter pushes territorial troops to control life through domination of female by alpha male physical supremacy, as in chimpanzees, and great apes, therefore life of primates is a high despotic due to lack of the high cognitive functions to bind to moral code. enforcement of domination, sanctioning by bullying, or killing are the usual ways for communicating discontent, and supremacy, alpha male position is maintained by feuds, and continuous display, display of subordinated males was perceived as revolutionary act that perils despotic rule, and prohibited by bullying any competitor.

2- long term socialization lead to development of borca area in homo-erectus, made transfer of knowledge much easier, and use of complex tools, fire, and increase sociability introduced better adaptation with nature, utilizing more resources, new possibilities for sanctioning including gossip, ostracism, and shifted inherited phenotypes that determined hierarchical roles to hunting skills, and introduced equality between hunters, hunting in coordinating groups gave equal political power to each hunter setting end of hierarchy on family level, achieving egalitarianism of prohibiting any sort of domination, display, or control. competition between coalition of forces on the band level pushed territorial demarcation for domination of resources for band survival, it was the first form of appropriation (first ownership) known to hominoids, an appropriation against outsiders.

3- with the end of ice age, and increased aridity in  8Kbr, and 6Kbr, forcing hunter-gather bands toward the rivers for more resources, investing resources in horticulture, and animal husbandry introduced land, and cattle ownership, it  was the second form of appropriation (second ownership), but against same tribe, and village members, the later required warriors to enforce ownership, overriding egalitarian moral ethos of suppressing sharp hunter-gatherers skills by introducing warriors culture rivalry, although warrior power remained democratic, more sedentary lifestyle resulted in passive sharing, and dependence on household resources weakening interdependence relationship between family unites, political power was shifted from heads of hunters toward successful warriors, regressing the degree of egalitarianism toward despotism, from linear direct power to triangular hierarchical power centralized in hand of warriors commander, especially in cases of conflicts.

# subordination of morality

4- rivalry between entities, is overcome by collations, raising hierarchy, the more challenging the target, or predator, the higher the hierarchy, and the more separated from it's body, raising voluntary economical, and political patron over confederation of villages, comes with it's benefits, and disadvantages, with centralizing power in hand of distant chief, duels are easily settled between different tribes, countering external villages coalition's, saves lifes were to be dissipated in intragroup, and tribal wars, and confederation facilitate trade between different villages by the big-man trader, the stability of the confederation stands against hardships compared to tribes, or foragers, but despite the shift in power to big-man, warriors-commander, and chief, they were still subject to public opinion, and needed to legitimize his rule by stability, and equalization.
     
5- separating political power from from it's body, through classes of nobility, and slaves, and those in between, by removing political power of tribe's chief from chieftain, throw away the need to legitimize authority by the king, as complete economical hegemony, and militarily in the hands of ruling class, the remaining of egalitarianism of hunter-gathers perishes, and morality hijacked by kingdom needs of survival, and loses it's role, although authority still lays under checks from public revolts, and discontent.

6- democracy in theory in contrast to egalitarianism is an intangible desire to achieve equalization, but in reality, it's most successful way for legitimizing inequality, and sucking ambivalence, and discontent, in nation of different religions, ideologies, traditions, and cultures, each representing a binding ethos for way of living, such that individual can only belong to one specific ethos (equivalence class), for two arbitrary ethos they might share common interests, aspiration, but also average conflicting philosophies (m), having a nation of (n) different ethos, implies that there is n times m conflicting ideas (degree of conflicts), the more cosmopolitan the city (a manifestation of assimilation) the more conflict can arise, making egalitarian, equalizing law intangible! why law enforcement would be required if it's morally accepted?! the separation of power from it's body in the chieftain was for countering external threats, and simple internal duels, in the state, strength of central power is proportional to degrees of internal conflicts n*m, for state to last with great n*m, tolerance to simple erupts, revolts is essential, in such successful dominating highly-assimilating democratic states, the citizen might have the elusion of freedom of expression, and equality! as long as it have safe ringing on the ears of majority of population, democracy itself is exported by globalization, and implied by it's blended conflicting cultures, ideas, philosophies, and religions.

# resurrection of moral-political society, turning despotism-egalitarian-despotism (V shape) trajectory back into egalitarianism (N shape)

7- with the creation of kingdom, homo-sapiens completely lost their sovereignty by the separation of political power from society in form of classes, hegemony of power, and resources by nobility, and elites perpetuated in forms of states, democratic nations, and most successfully in form of neoliberal state, taking back our sovereignty will required resurrecting egalitarian binding ethos, the moral code that hold the clan, band, tribe together for about 1.8 million years, a 98% of hominoids life! the current ubiquitous separation of power is a baby step against gravity!

8- moral, political society is restoration of egalitarian ethos of hunter-gathers of linear political power, by abolition of any central domination, or power through equal bottom-up political participation in common binding ethos of minimal conflicting ideals.

9- despotism arise from lack of direct communication between between related entities, as in case of chimpanzees (communication limited to gestures, grunts, and expressions), for band, or clan being limited to 30-80 members, and hunter-gatherers to around 150 forager, reaching despotism in the chieftain after separation of egalitarian chief from the tribe to village, as analogous to the state, with long hierarchy of top-down political power, similarly state rule manifested in law is separated from the governed body, by its nature implies despotism, to enforce a law means lack of acceptance, in which morality is an anti-state revolutionary act which perils the state rule similar to rival display in young aspiring chimpanzees to have equal shares of sex, the more powerful the state, the more probable to prosper, expand, and perpetuate through centuries, the less power the faster it head toward assimilation by more powerful competing self-propagating state  militarily, or economically, the priority of the dominating state is to strengthen it's power over every niche for it's self-preservation (implication of domination avarice motivated by low survival chances analogous to biological evolution, or kackzynski self-propagating systems) for the latter purpose the strength of top down rule must be strengthened with the same proportions of complexity of hierarchy, geography, and culture for the authoritative power to reach every niche, state law sanctified by priests, or legitimized by democracy is enforcement of state morality of authority, and domination for it's own survival, continuation, and self-propagation, any moral act inconsistent with law become illegitimate outlawed act, therefor law hinders moral development, and morals in generals, in that sense any society binded by morality such as tribe, primitive, indigenous, or traditionalist under the reach of the state perils it's propensity. a successful state is anti-social, it's in the interest of the state power to harshly suppress any attempt to reconcile with history, or nature, in the state citizen are forced to cut on their freedom (implied by high conflicting ethos) for the greater good of the state continuity, societal morality assimilated by state law, conceive citizens with no sense of originality, and belonging, therefore more propense to corruption, and ill-doing (disguised state morality), so alienated by surrogate activities they due to vanity and lack of fulfillment to justify their existence tend to accumulate capital, and possessions to maintain their insatiable arousal.

10- the coexistence of conflicting ethos, can only be achieved either through authoritarianism of certain ideology, by suppressing others, or democratically, through blending all views in arbitrary one, in both cases giving rise to despotic rule, which can never represent the whole society, and require cutting on freedom, leaving an unequal triangular despotic system. for minimal conflicts between binding ethos, a society must be as conformist as possible in regard to philosophy of living (binding ethos).

# dialectical force between morality, and social contract.

11- morality of living is what inherited from accumulating tradition, theology, philosophy or science, they are dynamic, evolving, it's unlimited development of common beliefs. any limitation, such as state law can hinder the development of morality to cope up with change in environment, relations, society, or reforms.

12- in theory social contract, or law in the system of conflicting ethos, define what majority perceive as representation of the whole directed toward common goal, with minimal cut on freedom, it try to achieve peace in coexistence with the state as inevitable peace making god for settling down conflicts. 

13- in moral-political society social contract can define concrete binding ethos of society with extensive details, through which the bonded members can use it for resolving conflicts for developing evolving binding ethos, contract is optimally written with logical proof for driven conclusion, in that sense, the optimal, most adaptive dynamic contract is ideological philosophical, over divine orders which required god intervention through religious reforms, or inherited untraceable culture which arbitrarily develops, as two extremes of moral social contract, therefore the philosophical ideological society, is the most flexible to cope with hardships, and most eligible for self-propagation, through analyzing new circumistances against old contract, the dialectical force of the two can evolve new version of social contract, and new society with new culture, behavior, and mentality.

# penalization individuals in 21 century

14- in egalitarian society of hunter-gathers, morality was enforced by penalizing deviance, through ostracism, execution, gossip, criticism depending on ethos, and degree of deviance from equality. from deterministic prospective, accumulation of knowledge in the 21 century, can enable us to trace any deviance from social contract i.e non-egalitarian, authoritative behavior, etc, if interpreted as economical, psychological, or mental problem and not as source of danger, deterministic any humane action is learned from environment, and affected by genetics, for penalizing humane action, all ancestors, guardians, neighbors, and teachers of the same equivalence class members need to be penalized equality, humane behavior can be optimally corrected, and indoctrinated in the academies for the desired ethos, acting as such can give more insight into innate humane nature, which can help in evolving moral social contract, especially in small society of minimal free-riders where nearly every member is essential of continuation of life! but morally the penalization should be left to interpretation of society members!

15- social contracting with external societies means different ethos, any violation can be penalized democratically, economically, or militarily without need for central power to be separated from its body, on the level of confederal politics, sanctioning, and penalization from the benefits of confederation can greatly affect deviant society.

16- punitive penalizing law need to be abolished, instead of developing conscience based on fear of assimilating law, working out the solution of deviant behavior cognitively can enhance social behavior in one generation using education.

# penalizing political institutions

17- moral-political society is the synergy of integrated communes for facilitating societal needs, each can be on average of size 150 according to Dunbar number if the commune to be democratic.

18- penalization of society commune is optimally to be done through reducing economical support, rather than penalizing their members, giving space for experimentation, innovation, and competition between different philosophies, and methodologies, converging to general ground truth between communes of common goals.

19- politics is practiced inside the societal communes according to it's philosophy, in moral-political society of conformist binding ideology, different communes is to be established to support the societal needs, and therefor the bigger this society, the bigger the number of communes of common goals, the stronger it gets in confronting environment, or external forces as contrasted to cancerous cosmopolitan city of millions of multi-ethnicity's, multi-cultural of conflicting ideas, the problem is the conflicting ethos, and state law that hinder moral development and reconciliation, and united directed goals, and not the size!

# upper-limit of strength of moral-political society

20- society size is upper-limited by the affiliation of advocated ethos.

21- the more tolerant the binding ethos, the more it can attract affiliations, the stronger it gets, and the more chances it will have for self-propagation, in the two extremes lies Divine, and logically driven philosophical ideological societies, tolerance to new ideas, can boost the evolution of the social contract, and give it higher chances for thriving, and self-propagation.
