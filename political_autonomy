## political autonomy

1- survival primary needs are basic needs required for survival which are agriculture, irrigation, food production, drinking water, accommodation, and energy.

2- preservation secondary needs are required for self-preservation, and progress, academies(committees inside each commune), self-defense, technology&connectivity, healthcare&pharmaceutics, commutation, diplomacy.

3- democratic political society is a hierarchy that can drive it's own decisions of self-governance internally as an autonomous entity, without any foreign influence, liberty means the ability to act arbitrarily, under no influence, but that of the administrated body itself, and using it's own resources to politicize survival, and preservation needs autonomously with no external dependence.

6- freedom in autonomous decision making require developing custom grass-root solution for any foreign dependence on satisfying survival, and preservation needs, a sovereign society is expected to sufficiently govern it's own economics autonomously, otherwise a society it subject to economical control, fluctuation, and domination by survival, and preservation needs provider, and therefore loses it's political sovereignty.

4- democratic moral political society bonded by coherent ethos is assumed to be egalitarian with equal distribution of political power over it's members.

5- a political weight is assumed to be directed toward uniting goal, from the population toward societal decision, and not the decision to be inflicted upon the population, the latter implies authoritative top-down power, but the former implies bottom-up power hierarchy analogous to egalitarian band, hunter-gatherers, or tribe (of voluntary chief).

7- external dependence on basic needs, implies the ineffectiveness of the societal philosophy, binding ethos, or state morality for conceiving vigilant, active, responsible members, and therefore vulnerable to external domination of successful self-propagating systems, so economical dependence on survival, and preservation needs is different side for domination, and control.

8- after achieving autonomous self-sufficiency in primary needs required for survival without external influence, under no effect of global economical crises, a society can move forward to develop it's secondary needs for continuity achieving self-sufficiency in academia by developing grass-root societal sciences inseparable from the society itself for discovering, understanding, healing, and protecting the society, and the environment, self-defense based academia for outperforming enemy weaponry sufficient for self-preservation of it's own moral-political societal sovereignty, technology and connectivity for automating monotonous work for machinery, to emancipate fellow humane from slavery, and societal burdens for maximizing productivity in humane interesting, and challenging work worthy of human's effort, and precious time.

9- to achieve egalitarianism political power need to head upward from the population of equal political weight to the decision in hand, with no external political, economical, militarily or any kind of avoidable external influence.

10- being economically dependent for survival, give the possibility for domination by cutting supply of basic needs in embargo, or economical sanctioning can bombard the alleged-autonomous society, or state with crises, can and lead to famines in few months, while dependence for self-preservation needs can perils stability, progress, and prosperity, and eventually reducing it's chances of survival, and self-propagation on the long term, if supplies of technology, and knowledge were to be cut.

## territorial autonomy isn't enough for egalitarianism.

11- any form of external dependence or influence is potential threat to egalitarianism, and shall be abolished, otherwise alleged-autonomous system is vulnerable to be assimilated by competing self-propagating hegemonous powers for colonizing their resources, constitutional autonomy is more degenerate than involuntary oppression, assimilation, and domination, as the former is voluntary salvation, economically, militarily, or politically colonized countries, or societies administrators will act as ambassadors for the dominating power in their own land, facilitating domination and control.

12- Constitution independence in most of cases implies economical dependence due to domination of knowledge and intelligence by bigger self-propagating systems, demarcating borders isn't enough for liberty, freedom, and egalitarian political power, demarcation shall be extended to any form of dependence without periling survival or self-preservation, that can only be done by political autonomy, in all fields! autonomy is always mistaken to be interpreted as territorial autonomy, such case always been subject to assimilation be dominating economical self-propagating systems even Constitution independence was created by dominating forces! a more economical approach, it requires lower cost.

13- the pragmatism of achieving quasi-economical, quasi-political, or quasi-democratic autonomy is ill-defined, and each implies some arbitrary degree of dependence but to maintain democracy, or egalitarian political power, the line of dependence shall be put between survival, self-preservation needs, and luxurious goods, bottom-up diplomacy based-off direct democracy of equal power weight distribution, and external influence.

14- any compromise with liberty of egalitarianism is degradation to human freedom to act arbitrarily, and descending to degenerate form of domesticated animals, beyond egalitarian hominoids of 1.8 million years, degradation down below despotism of the close primates like chimpanzees! for chimpanzees who achieve autonomy in satisfying survival needs, a necessity mandated by their beating heart, such autonomy have been slipped away from state oversocialized citizens worldwide, and instead they are enslaved in surrogate activities, doing others work for treats.

15- liberty of egalitarianism may only be compromised for life!
